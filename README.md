# Data Analytics Report - Building Power BI Dashboards for Clovis Unified School District's Device Inventory Database

## Project Overview:
This repository is a summary of the process of how I created two Power BI dashboards for my internship at Clovis Unified School District (CUSD). Disclaimer: Due to privacy and confidentiality agreements with CUSD's technology department, the actual data used in these projects cannot be included in this repository. The dashboards showcased here were built using their private inventory database. Only screenshots of the final visualizations will be shown here.


## Dashboard 1: Chromebook Data Dashboard

The **Chromebook Data Dashboard** consists of three key pages:
1. **OS Version**: Displays the distribution of Chromebook OS versions using stacked bar charts and includes dynamic bins for any new OS versions added to the data.
2. **End of Support**: Tracks Chromebooks' support statuses, with similar visualization layouts to the OS Version page.
3. **Last Sync Date**: Shows the last sync dates of each Chromebook, with the added functionality of filters and bins to easily select devices based on their sync dates.

### Key Features:
- **Slicer Functionality**: Allows users to filter results by one or multiple locations within the district (e.g., Clovis West High School).
- **Dynamic Binning**: Automatically adjusts OS version bins as new data is pulled.
- **Card Visualizations**: Provides quick, at-a-glance totals for device statistics.
- **Detailed Tables**: Lists individual devices and their associated OS versions.

## Project 2: Windows Device Data Dashboard

The **Windows Device Data Dashboard** was a 2-page interactive dashboard that filtered data by categories such as Year Acquired and OS Version. This project followed a similar structure to the Chromebook dashboard, but I was able to complete it much more efficiently, having gained experience from the previous project.

### Key Features:
- **Slicers and Filters**: Users can filter the data based on year, OS version, and other important categories.
- **Efficient Design**: Leveraged experience from the Chromebook dashboard project to quickly build and refine the Windows device dashboard.

## Reflection

This internship provided me with invaluable technical and soft skills. I learned to work with data pipelines from MySQL Workbench into Power BI, developing dashboards that were both informative and user-friendly. The biggest challenge was making dynamic bins for OS version data, which I overcame with a deeper understanding of Power BI's functionalities. This experience has greatly enhanced my proficiency in Power BI and MySQL, while also teaching me the importance of data visualization in decision-making.
